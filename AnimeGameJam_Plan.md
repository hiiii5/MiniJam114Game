## Overview
The goal of this project is to deliver a fun an inviting experience where players seek to advance their village. The player starts with minimal resources and an existing city to aid them starting their adventure. After the tutorial, the city is destroyed, and its survivors are absorbed into the players village.

A player can be considered to have won the game when the antagonist that destroys the city is defeated. The players time of play is not limited and can continue playing to grow the city.
